## Implementation Status

This is a **PyTorch implementation** of the GBCNet architecture from the paper. The model architecture has been implemented but **has not been trained or tested yet**. This repository is provided for research and educational purposes.
I will test it soon and will show the metrics on real-life datasets of ultrasound images.
